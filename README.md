# Length of Stay Prediction Using ML Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the length of stay (LOS) of patients in a healthcare setting using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The goal is to provide healthcare providers with accurate predictions to enhance resource management, optimize patient flow, and improve overall care delivery.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Insights and visualizations of the predictions

## Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes clinical and demographic information of patients. The features include:

- Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Clinical data (diagnoses, procedures, etc.)
- Admission details (type of admission, length of stay, etc.)

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and any data preprocessing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and performance metrics.
- `results/`: Visualizations, evaluation metrics, and other results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/length-of-stay-prediction.git
    cd length-of-stay-prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data for modeling:
      ```bash
      python src/preprocess_data.py
      ```

2. **Model Training:**
    - Train the machine learning models using the preprocessed data:
      ```bash
      python src/train_models.py
      ```

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the performance of the trained models:
      ```bash
      python src/evaluate_models.py
      ```

4. **Results and Visualizations:**
    - Generate visualizations and insights from the predictions:
      ```bash
      python src/visualize_results.py
      ```

## Results

The project provides a comprehensive analysis of various machine learning algorithms applied to predict the length of stay. The results include model performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R^2 score, along with visualizations that help in understanding the model predictions and their implications.
